# rate.hs

This is `rate.hs`. I'm learning Haskell by implementing a web app with Snap
and postgresql-simple (with the idea to switch to Persistent later).

Rate.hs will be a web app where you can create categories and "rates". A rate
can have a title, description and a rating, of course. It must be placed in a
category, whereas a category could be placed in another category.

So, this is nothing too complicated. I hope I can learn Haskell and Snap and
so on so I can continue with a larger Project afterwards, namingly "Hamot",
the Haskell Money Tracker. So this is a learning project and nothing too
serious.

Feel free to send me _suggestions_ anyways!
